# Configuration

Lantor reads configuration from environment variables. All of them are
optional — the defaults work for local development. The most common ones
also appear in [`.env.example`](../.env.example).

## Core

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LANTOR_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite://~/Library/Application Support/Lantor/lantor.sqlite` | SQLite database URL used by both the desktop process and the web server. `DATABASE_URL` is honored as a fallback only when it is also a `sqlite:` URL. |
| `LANTOR_WEB_BIND` | `0.0.0.0:8787` | Address the embedded web/SSE server binds to. Set to `127.0.0.1:8787` to stay loopback-only, or `off` / `none` to disable the browser UI entirely. |

## Web UI

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LANTOR_WEB_PUBLIC_URL` | derived from `LANTOR_WEB_BIND` | Public base URL Lantor uses when generating links that point at itself. Set this when the bind address is not directly reachable (for example behind a reverse proxy or when using a Tailscale MagicDNS name). |
| `LANTOR_WEB_DIST` | auto-detected `dist/` next to the repo or current working directory | Override the static web bundle directory served by the desktop process. Useful when running a packaged build from a custom location. |

## Attachments

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LANTOR_ATTACHMENT_DIR` | `~/Library/Application Support/Lantor/attachments` | Disk location where Lantor copies inbound message attachments. Point this at an alternative volume if you want attachments stored outside `~/Library`. |

## Runtime tuning

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LANTOR_CODEX_CONTEXT_ROTATE_INPUT_TOKENS` | `180000` | Rotate warm Codex sessions when the last stopped run exceeds this many input tokens. Lantor ignores values below `50000` to avoid churning sessions unnecessarily. |

## Call Mode System Agent

Call Mode uses generated System Agent text for both spoken dispatch
acknowledgements and follow-up status feedback. By default both generators run
`codex exec` with `gpt-5.4-mini` and low reasoning effort. Set the command
variables only when you need to route either generator through another local
program. Custom commands receive request JSON on stdin and must return only the
expected JSON object on stdout.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LANTOR_CALL_COORDINATOR_COMMAND` | generated `codex exec` command | Override the Call Mode Dispatcher Agent. It must return JSON with a `tool` such as `speak_to_user`, `ask_user`, `dispatch_agent_work`, or `cancel_call_work`, plus spoken `say` text. |
| `LANTOR_CALL_COORDINATOR_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Model used by the default coordinator command. Ignored when `LANTOR_CALL_COORDINATOR_COMMAND` is set. |
| `LANTOR_CALL_COORDINATOR_REASONING_EFFORT` | `low` | Reasoning effort passed to the default coordinator command. Ignored when `LANTOR_CALL_COORDINATOR_COMMAND` is set. |
| `LANTOR_CALL_FEEDBACK_COMMAND` | generated `codex exec` command | Override generated System Agent status feedback for call-linked worker replies and completed call work. It must return JSON with `message_text`. |
| `LANTOR_CALL_FEEDBACK_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Model used by the default feedback command. Ignored when `LANTOR_CALL_FEEDBACK_COMMAND` is set. |
| `LANTOR_CALL_FEEDBACK_REASONING_EFFORT` | `low` | Reasoning effort passed to the default feedback command. Ignored when `LANTOR_CALL_FEEDBACK_COMMAND` is set. |

## Notes

- Lantor does not perform its own browser auth. Only expose the web UI on
  trusted private networks (loopback or Tailscale). See
  [Tailscale web access](web-access.md) for the recommended setup.
- Schema migrations run automatically the first time the desktop process
  connects to a fresh database — there is no separate migration step.
- Agent-local environment such as `LANTOR_AGENT_ID`, `LANTOR_RUN_ID`,
  `LANTOR_CONTEXT_TOOL`, and `LANTOR_WORK_ITEM_*` is injected into agent
  subprocesses by the supervisor and is not meant to be set by users.
